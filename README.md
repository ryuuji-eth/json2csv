# json2csv
README.md last updated 14/12/21
Python script that exports json file contents to csv file.

Version 0.2.1 needs to be run within the json files directory. Later versions will hopefully include file directory user input and a menu.

What works:
- Scanning directory and adding json filenames to a list
- Using the current directory + json filenames to import json files as dictionary
- Export to csv file (sometimes)

What's missing:
- Error handling
- User input
- Being able to save to other formats besides csv
